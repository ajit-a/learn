Example 1: Integer Addition

Description:
This example contains a client and a server that communicate via XML-RPC.
The client takes as command-line parameters the address of the server (in 
the form host:port), as well as two integers.  The client executes the 
"server.add" RPC on the server, passing the two strings as parameters.
Normally, these strings would be converted to integers and validated by 
the client, but this example is designed to demonstrate exception 
handling in XML-RPC.  If the server cannot convert the two strings to 
integers, it throws an exception, which is caught by the client.  If 
the two integers are valid, the server adds them and returns the sum 
as the return value of the RPC.

XML-RPC Libraries:
This example uses the xmlrpc-c library: xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net.
NOTE: The C++ XML-RPC libraries are currently only installed on ccc1, so that
is the only machine that can successfully build the C++ example.

Building Example 1:
To build the example, use the build.sh script.

Ex: ./build.sh or sh build.sh.

If you implement your assignments in C++, you should modify the Makefile from 
this example to build your assignments.  There are many libraries that are 
required to to build a C++ program that uses this C++ MXL-RPC library, and the 
order of the libraries matters.  It would be easiest to modify this Makefile 
for your projects.

Executing Example 1:
Use the  start_client.sh and start_server.sh scripts.  Currently the C++ 
examples will only execute on ccc1.

Ex: To start the server on port 9382
./start_server.sh 9382

Ex: To execute the server.add RPC on the server started above, adding 2+2
./start_client.sh ccc1.wpi.edu:9382 2 2

You can test out the exception handling by providing invalid input.
Ex: ./start_client.sh ccc1.wpi.edu:9382 2 A

The server can be shutdown via XML-RPC by using the following command:
./start_client.sh ccc1.wpi.edu:9382 shutdown

One of the best advantages of XML-RPC is that it is language-independent.
Try using the C++ client with the Java server or vice versa.
